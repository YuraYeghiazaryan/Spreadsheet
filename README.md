# Spreadsheet
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my Google Spreadsheet simulation project! 
This project simulates the working of Google Spreadsheet and allows users 
to create a table and perform various manipulations with it.

Users can change the positions of rows and columns, 
add new rows and columns, and change the cell array types. 
This simulation aims to provide users with a similar experience
to using Google Spreadsheet, while also giving them the ability to 
customize their tables and manipulate them as needed.
